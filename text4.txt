Q. 1 (a) Design a Code converter from Gray code to excess-3 code. (5)
(b) The literal count of a Boolean expression is the no. of times each literal apprears in the expression. For
example, the literal count of (xy + x z’) is 4. What are the minimum possible literal counts of the POS
and SOP representations respectively of the function given below? (5)
f(w, x, y, z) = ¥ m(1, 2, 5, 12) + ¥ d(O, 7, 8, 10, 13, 15)

Q. 2 (a) How many 3 to 8 line decoders with enable I/P are needed to construct a 12 to 4096 line decoder?
Draw logical circuit. (2)

(b) A priority generator accepts three inputs (A3, Aj and Aj) and produce a two-bit output (X; and Xo)
corresponding to the highest priority active input signal. A; has highest priority and A; has lowest
priority. If none of inputs are active, the output should be 00. Design a priority generator circuit with
NAND gates only. (4)

(e.g. In combination A3= 1, A> = 1 and A; = 0, A; is active and has highest priority. So, output will be
X, =1and Xo=1.
